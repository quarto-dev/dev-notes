For these measurements, I'm using a machine where `quarto render` on `quarto-web` takes about 240s to render on 359 files.

Some functions I've inspected and considered optimizing today:

| name | time per call | number of calls | upper bound on perf win |
|-|-|-|-|
| `resolveBootstrapScss` | 1.8ms | #files | 0.26% |
| `cleanSourceMappingUrl` | 2.3ms | #files | 0.34% |
| `extensionContext.find` | 2.7ms | #files | 0.4% |

I think there's not a lot to be done here for now, and I should go back
to Pandoc+Lua.
