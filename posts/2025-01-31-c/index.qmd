Up to commit []{.github-commit hash="ca0587692627150b5693113a89b6ce745b95b0c6"}, Quarto had a three-stage filter
for parsing custom AST nodes. The last stage existed to [fix a bug](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/7045),
but turned out to be quite onerous in terms of overall performance.

Commit []{.github-commit hash="5aaaff00c2c5e332a5d9aa4573778c7a3f46f999"} rewrites the fix to happen inside the parsing itself.
The result is a 1.5% overall reduction in rendering `quarto-web`.
