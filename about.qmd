These are internal notes we, the Quarto devs, are writing.

::: callout-important

We're using these notes as external shared memory. We truly mean the following: we make no promises that anything here will make sense to anyone else!

:::

Think of the silly "if you're not embarrassed by your first iteration, you took too long to ship" saying. We're truly putting that to the test here.

We're making these notes public because it's easier for us to collect them between ourselves in this way than not to.

You're welcome to read them!
But if you're not a Quarto developer (eg, you have a commit to `quarto-dev/quarto` or `quarto-dev/quarto-cli` under your name), we unfortunately won't have time to take your read your feedback.
